[VisDrone2019-VID Dataset](https://github.com/VisDrone/VisDrone-Dataset) (Train set option)

After downloading, place the extracted dataset in the correct path by modifying `sequence_path` in `demo1.py`:
```python
sequence_path = "./path_to_your_dataset/sequences/uav0000020_00406_v"
```
Ensure the dataset path is correctly set before running the script.

## Running the Code
